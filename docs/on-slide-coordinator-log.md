# On-Slide UX — Coordinator Log

Durable, repo-tracked narrative for the `onslide-coordinator` skill. Re-read this
on every rehydrate. State of record: session SQL `todos` (status) + git (`[todo: <id>]`
markers). Intent of record: `docs/on-slide-ux-plan.md`.

## Backlog (seeded at bootstrap)

| id | depends on | gate |
|---|---|---|
| disco-ops-harness | — | `native\build-ops.bat` → `OPS HARNESS OK` |
| disco-slide-window | — | `native\build-window-probe.bat` → `window-classes.txt` exists |
| ops-model-mutations | disco-ops-harness | `native\build-ops.bat` → `OPS HARNESS OK` |
| ctx-menu-actions | ops-model-mutations | `native\build.bat` → `[build] OK` |
| overlay-material | — | `native\build.bat` → `[build] OK` (+ overlay png) |
| overlay-toolbar | overlay-material, ops-model-mutations, disco-slide-window | `native\build.bat` → `[build] OK` |
| hover-rowband | disco-slide-window, overlay-material | `native\build.bat` → `[build] OK` |
| inline-edit | disco-slide-window, ops-model-mutations | `native\build.bat` → `[build] OK` |

Every native unit also re-runs `build-conformance.bat` (`1/1 fixtures passed`) and
`build-reflow.bat` + `ppreflow.exe` (`REFLOW PASS`) as regression gates.

## Cycle log

- bootstrap — seeded 8 units + 9 dep edges; schema extended with structured columns;
  integrity clean (0 missing deps, 3 ready). Next: self-review, then dispatch the
  three ready no-dep units (discovery first).
